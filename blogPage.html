			<h1>TP2</h1>
			<p>28/01/19</p>
		</header>
		<p>This week we received feedback for our MVP presentation and code. Overall,
			 the feedback was positive, especially for our presentation. We were commended for
			  being able to still engage the audience baring in mind that we were last to present after around 16 groups.
				 However, the software of our code was said to be more of an alpha product as opposed to an MVP
				  product due to the lack of functionality.</p>
		<p>After the feedback meeting we made a rough plan based on what was said.
			 We started off working on the quality assurance plan and listing all points we wanted to talk about then
			 refining it to sub headings. Doing this allowed us to delegate topics to each member fairly. </p>
		<p>We then went on to discuss the features of the game that we wanted for the final product.
			 This was a long process of determining what features would realistically be completed in the next
			  8 weeks and those that were just a tad bit ambitious.  Then we ordered the features in order of priority,
				 broke them down into weeks and delegated tasks to each team member. </p>

			<h1>It’s Deadline Week</h1>
			<p>03/12/18</p>
		</header>
		<p>So far this week the website functions are now fully implemented, the required maps are completed
			and some sort of dialogue implementation has been implemented and there is interaction between NPCs and the player.</p>
		<p>A day until we present and the entire team is feeling the pressure.</p>
		<p><i> dun dun dunnnnnnnn</i> </p>
		<p>It’s the day of the presentation and we have come very far from where we were last week, however,
			 we decided to remove the features that weren’t fully implemented to allow or game to run bug free
			  and to look as refined as possible.</p>
		<p>As a group we reflected and decided that the presentation went well.
			 Unfortunately, all the features we wanted to show off in the demonstration were not fully completed so
			 that limited us to a short demo. However, luckily the unconventional nature of our presentation
			 somewhat compensated for our lack of feature in our game.</p>

			<h1>A week before!</h1>
			<p>26/11/18</p>
		</header>
		<p> Only a week left and we still have a lot of work to do! So it was time to be realistic.
			This week we rearranged our schedules and what we initially planned to get done for the MVP and increased our meeting hours. </p>
		<p>The storyline and scene images are all complete, the only issue now is figuring out how to implement the scene images into the start of our game. </p>
		<p> Dialogue was one of our main feature we wanted to get done for this week. However, it was underestimated how long it would take as there were struggles
				with the implementation so this feature will be carried over to the next week.</p>
		<p>Graphics team created a band new map for our candy planet, which is looking very sweet!</p>
		<p> The website made great progress this week. The responsiveness issues with the text box on the blog page was fixed, slide show is finally showing off
				screenshots of our game. All that is left now is  to fix the text on the home page.</p>

			<h1>Slowly but surely</h1>
			<p>19/11/18</p>
		</header>
		<p>Having had a productive previous week and progressed with the animations and interactions between characters our to-do list was looking slightly less overwhelming.
			This week the player and NPC interaction was completed, there was also a few improvements made by the graphics team with the enemy character. </p>
		<p>As a group we came up with a vague story line for our opening scene, then a few of us went away to refine the story and draw up a storyboard
			 with the associated dialogue. </p>
		<p> So far so good with the game website, with all the sections set up all that’s left to do is fill them with our content.
				 However, we are having some issues with its responsiveness. This will be our main and hopefully the last step to completing the website.</p>

			<h1>What’s the Plan?  </h1>
			<p>12/11/18</p>
		</header>
		<p>This week we set up an action plan. This firstly started off very optimistically until we began a never ending list of things we needed to get done for the the Minimum
				Viable Product (MVP) presentation, and how much time this would take. With these tasks we all decided as a group the priorities of the tasks. The Deadlines we gave
				to these tasks were dependent on the priorities. </p>
		<p> The high priority tasks included animations, interaction and dialogue between characters, battle algorithms and the opening scene.
				It was decided to focus on these tasks first as we knew it would require some research and tutorials in order to implement them.</p>
		<p>Alongside  this, the graphics team began creating maps and  player / NPC sprite sheets. This is an ongoing task as we will require
			 new maps for the different planets and potential character updates. </p>
